### INRODUCTION
Gemini AI is Google's latest AI model, designed to be more powerful and capable than its predecessor. It's expected to be the most powerful AI ever built. 
Gemini is multimodal, which means it can seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and video. It can also master human-style conversations, language, and content, understand and interpret images, code prolifically and effectively, drive data and analytics, and be used by developers to create new AI apps and APIs. 
Gemini was trained on Google's in-house AI chips and tensor processing units, such as the TPU v4 and v5e. It's one of the most flexible models on the market and one of the most efficient.

### Description:
A simple qna chatgpt type app which also has a feature of including images as a prompt. The main aim is to showcase the power of GEMINI API to create efficient LLM applications for various problem statements.

## How to get started :

### Step1: Requirements:
Python version >= 3.10.0 is required.
run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your console/terminal to install the necessary python libraries.

### Step2: Get the Gemini API:
go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey , generate an API key and then copy it.

### Step3: make a .env file : 
Make a file named ".env" and assign the API key to a variable:

then save this file.

### AND THERE YOU GO , YOU CAN RUN ANY ONE OF THE APPS TO TEST IT ( chat.py , qachat.py , vision.py )
### here is a snippet of the application.
